To get this example up and running with MIT's speech recognition web-services 
you will need to supply a valid developer email and key.  These can be obtained
for free at http://wami.csail.mit.edu:8080/portal/developers.jsp

Once you have a key, go to your config.xml file, and replace XX 
in the following two lines:

<param name="developerEmail" value="XX" />
<param name="developerKey" value="XX" />
